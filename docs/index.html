      <!-- Bauhaus -->
      <article class="card" id="bauhaus">
        <h2>Bauhaus (1919–1933)</h2>

        <p>
          Bauhaus framed design as a reproducible system: craft aligned with industry, guided by functionalism and geometric abstraction. In typography and layout, it reduced ornament, favored sans-serif forms, and treated negative space as an active compositional tool. The movement’s pedagogy pushed “form follows function” into practical artifacts—posters, publications, and objects—where clarity and visual economy mattered more than style. This modernist method became a foundation later refined into stricter typographic rules.

          <li>Functionalism</li>
          <li>Form follows function</li>
          <li>Geometric abstraction</li>
          <li>Sans-serif</li>
          <li>Negative space</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="examples">
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/220977" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoMA: Herbert Bayer — Poster design (1923)</a></li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Confusion:</strong> Not to be confused with Art Deco because Bauhaus minimizes ornament for function, while Art Deco celebrates decorative luxury.</p>

        <p><strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified this by checking MoMA’s collection records for Herbert Bayer.</p>

      <!-- Swiss Style -->
      <article class="card" id="swiss">
        <h2>Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)</h2>

        <p>
          Swiss Style formalized modern typography into a repeatable method built on the grid system. Designers used modular grids, precise alignment, and typographic hierarchy to produce objective design—communication that prioritizes clarity over personal voice. Asymmetrical composition and strict control of spacing created clean reading paths, often anchored by neutral sans-serif type. Where Bauhaus introduced modernist reduction, Swiss Style tightened it into disciplined information design meant to work across contexts.

          <li>Grid system</li>
          <li>Modular grid</li>
          <li>Typographic hierarchy</li>
          <li>Alignment</li>
          <li>Objective design</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="examples">
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoMA: Müller-Brockmann — Musica Viva (1958)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/artists/4154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoMA: Josef Müller-Brockmann (works)</a></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Confusion:</strong> Not to be confused with Minimalism because Swiss Style is a typographic system (grids, hierarchy), not only “simplicity.”</p>

      <!-- New Wave Typography -->
      <article class="card" id="new-wave">
        <h2>New Wave Typography (late 1970s–1990s)</h2>

        <p>
          New Wave typography reacted against Swiss neutrality by breaking the grid and reintroducing expressive structure. Designers used layering, typographic experimentation, and deconstruction to create tension—fragmented alignments, shifting scales, and deliberately unstable reading sequences. While it rejected strict objective design, it still relied on typographic craft: rules were bent intentionally rather than ignored. Closely tied to postmodernism and later energized by early digital tools, New Wave positioned typography as voice, not just system.

          <li>Typographic experimentation</li>
          <li>Layering</li>
          <li>Deconstruction</li>
          <li>Anti-grid</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="examples">
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/86504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoMA: Weingart — Typographic Process Nr. 2 (1973)</a></li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Confusion:</strong> Not to be confused with Grunge Typography because New Wave breaks structure intentionally, while Grunge centers distress and anti-legibility.</p>

        <p><strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified this by checking MoMA’s Weingart record and Cooper Hewitt’s Greiman profile.</p>
