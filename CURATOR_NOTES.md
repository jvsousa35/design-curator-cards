## Card 1 — Bauhaus (1919–1933)

### Defining traits
- Unity of art, craft, and industry
- Functionalism (“form follows function” logic)
- Geometric abstraction
- Reduction of ornamentation
- Standardized design systems

### Key people / places
- Walter Gropius (founder)
- Herbert Bayer (typography)
- László Moholy-Nagy
- Paul Klee
- Wassily Kandinsky
- Bauhaus Dessau building

### Vocabulary bank
- Functionalism
- Form follows function
- Geometric abstraction
- Sans-serif typography
- Modernism
- Rationalism
- Visual economy
- Industrial design
- Negative space

### Real examples to verify later
- Bauhaus Dessau Foundation (official archive)
- MoMA Bauhaus collection

### Notes / angles
Bauhaus established modernist design principles emphasizing clarity, function, and system-based thinking. It laid the groundwork for typographic and structural discipline that later movements refined.

## Card 2 — Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)

### Defining traits
- Grid-based layout systems
- Asymmetrical composition
- Objective photography
- Clean sans-serif typography
- Strict typographic hierarchy

### Key people / places
- Josef Müller-Brockmann
- Emil Ruder
- Armin Hofmann
- Max Bill
- Zurich School of Design

### Vocabulary bank
- International Typographic Style
- Grid system
- Modular grid
- Typographic hierarchy
- Alignment
- Objective design
- Helvetica
- Akzidenz-Grotesk
- Information design

### Real examples to verify later
- Museum für Gestaltung Zürich
- MoMA Swiss poster collections

### Notes / angles
Swiss Style formalized and systematized modernist principles introduced by Bauhaus. It emphasized neutrality, clarity, and mathematical precision in typography and layout.

## Card 3 — New Wave Typography (Late 1970s–1990s)

### Defining traits
- Experimental typography
- Broken grid systems
- Layered compositions
- Expressive letterforms
- Postmodern influence

### Key people / places
- Wolfgang Weingart
- April Greiman
- Dan Friedman
- Basel School influence

### Vocabulary bank
- Postmodernism
- Typographic experimentation
- Deconstruction
- Anti-grid
- Visual layering
- Vernacular typography
- Expressive form
- Conceptual typography

### Real examples to verify later
- Wolfgang Weingart typographic experiments (Basel)
- April Greiman poster archives

### Notes / angles
New Wave reacted against Swiss typographic rigidity by intentionally disrupting grid discipline. While still rooted in typographic craft, it embraced expression, layering, and visual tension.

# Controlled Vocabulary (20 Domain Terms)

1. Functionalism — Design prioritizing practical purpose over decoration.
2. Form follows function — Form shaped by intended use.
3. Geometric abstraction — Shapes reduced to geometric forms.
4. Sans-serif — Typeface without finishing strokes.
5. Typographic hierarchy — Structured ordering of textual importance.
6. Grid system — Layout framework ensuring alignment and consistency.
7. Modular grid — Grid built from repeatable structural units.
8. Asymmetrical composition — Balanced layout without mirror symmetry.
9. Objective design — Visual neutrality minimizing personal expression.
10. Visual economy — Maximum clarity using minimal elements.
11. Information design — Structuring visuals to communicate data clearly.
12. Legibility — Ease of recognizing letters and words.
13. Alignment — Precise lining of elements along shared edges.
14. Negative space — Intentional empty space shaping composition.
15. Postmodernism — Skepticism toward universal design rules.
16. Typographic experimentation — Testing unconventional type structures.
17. Layering — Overlapping elements to create visual depth.
18. Deconstruction — Breaking conventions to expose visual structure.
19. Vernacular typography — Referencing everyday typographic forms.
20. Anti-grid — Intentional resistance to rigid grid systems.

# Confusions & Boundaries

### Bauhaus vs. Art Deco
Both emerged in the early 20th century, but Bauhaus prioritizes function and minimalism, while Art Deco emphasizes ornament, luxury, and decorative stylization.

### Swiss Style vs. Minimalism
Swiss Style is not merely simple; it relies on strict grid systems, typographic hierarchy, and objectivity. Minimalism can be aesthetic-first without Swiss structural discipline.

### New Wave vs. Grunge Typography
New Wave disrupts the grid with intentional typographic experimentation while maintaining design craft. Grunge emphasizes distressed textures and anti-legibility as core aesthetics.

### Swiss Style vs. Bauhaus
Bauhaus was a multidisciplinary design school blending art and craft experimentation. Swiss Style is a later typographic system emphasizing mathematical precision and neutrality.
